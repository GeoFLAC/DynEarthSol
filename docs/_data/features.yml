  - title: "Explicit dynamic relaxation"
    excerpt: "DynEarthSol finds static or quasi-static equilibrium through dynamic relaxation. Combined with the explicit time marching, this feature significantly simplifies the overall algorithm."

  - title: "Updated Lagrangian scheme"
    excerpt: "DynEarthSol can simulate large deformations within the framework of small-strain kinematics and naturally keep track of free boundary deformation. It also enjoys the power of dynamic mesh adaption."

  - title: "Various material models"
    excerpt: "DynEarthSol provides linear elasticity, poro-elasticity, Mohr-Coulomb plasticity with strain or rate-and-state weakening, and Maxwell viscoelasticity. DynEarthSol make it  easy to implement new material models."
