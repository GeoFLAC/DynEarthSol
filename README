DynEarthSol3D is a finite element code that solves the momentum balance and 
the heat transfer in Lagrangian form using unstructured meshes. It can be
used to study the long-term deformation of Earth's lithosphere and problems
alike.


===========
Build
===========

Requirement:
* You will need a recent C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard. (GNU g++
  4.4 or newer version will suffice.)
* You will need a recent version of Boost::Program_options library (1.42 or
  newer version).
* You will need Python 2.6 or 2.7 and the Numpy package.

Build procedure:
* Edit 'Makefile', modify BOOST_ROOT_DIR and BOOST_LDFLAGS if your boost
  library is not installed in the system directory.
* Run "make" to build an optimized 2D executable 'dynearthsol2d'.
* Run "make ndims=3" to build an optimized 3D executable 'dynearthsol3d'.
* Run "make opt=0" to build a debugging executable.
* Run "make openmp=0" to build the executable without OpenMP. This is
  necessary to debug under valgrind.


===========
Run
===========

* "dynearthsol2d inputfile"
* An example of input file is provided as 'defaults.cfg'
* Execute the executable with '-h' flag to see the available input parameters
  and their descriptions.


===========
Plot
===========

* Run "2vtk.py modelname" to convert the binary output to VTK files. 
* Some of the simulation outputs might be disabled. Edit 2vtk.py and
  output.cxx to disable/enable them.
* Plot the VTK files with Paraview or LLNL's Visit program.
